# I sense a disturbance in the traffic flow

## Task

There is a web server here which is listening on port 80. Modify the Terraform configuration to make it high availability. Anything else to improve?

The Terraform configuration will ask you to enter an SSH key name to setup the EC2 instance.

## Validation

* Can withstand loss of an availability zone.
* Reasonable security.
