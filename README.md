# Skill challenges

A way to demonstrate various technical skills.

# How to take the challenge

* You will have been set this git repository as a zip/tar file.
* Don't upload it to Github, or another public hosted git service.
* Each subdirectory contains various technical challenges.
* Read the `README.md` in each folder to work out what to do.
* Complete at least 3 challenges by following the instructions.
* Commit changes to the git repo.
* Mark the challenges you've completed by updating the checkboxes (from [ ] to [x]).
* Zip up the directory when you've finished and send it back to whoever sent it to you.

# Challenges

## General

Our clients use a variety of programming languages. The nature of consultancy means we could be working on a range of languages, so use any language you think is appropriate to carry out these challenges.

* [x] [/general/country_list](/general/country_list) - We need an API to return the name of the country based on its ISO ID.
* [x] [/general/food_standards](/general/food_standards) - Avoiding food poisoning is an essential skill. Help me find the safest and worst restaurants in Leeds.
* [x] [/general/football](/general/football) - One of our customers runs a football score prediction game. Can we help their players guess the score by providing access to historic data?

## Cloud

Lots of our projects involve the use of public cloud infrastructure. We want to use the best tools for each client and project, so we're cloud agnostic. We're currently Advanced AWS Partners, and are also working with Google and Microsoft cloud technology. 

* [ ] [/cloud/unbalanced](/cloud/unbalanced) - Our customers usually want their systems to be highly available but this Terraform AWS configuration isn't. Can we make it highly available and maybe improve it in some other ways?

## SQL

Many systems you will work with have a relational database within them.

As consultants, we need to be able to work with lots of different types of SQL databases since we don't know what systems our clients will be using.

Core skills:

* Querying databases
* Troubleshooting performance problems
* Bulk import / export
* Basic administration (backups / restore)
* Migrating queries between SQL language variants

Challenges:

* [x] [/sql/customer_orders](/sql/customer_orders) - One of our customer's engineers needs a hand writing some basic SQL. Can you help them?

## JavaScript

2018 JavaScript is a completely different thing to 1998 JavaScript, but you'll likely encounter at least one modern JavaScript front-end framework, such as React, Vue or Angular.

We need you to be flexible enough to acquire these skills, even if you don't have them today.

* [x] [/js/modernise](/js/modernise) - Bring some old-fashioned javascript up-to-date.

# Contribution

The challenges here were added by members of our Engineering Practice, based on real-world scenarios we face day-to-day.

We want to make sure that people who join us can deal with the day-to-day stuff well enough, so that we know they'll also be able to handle the hard stuff when it comes along.

We like things to be as simple as they should be. We don't need to make the challenges over-complex (e.g. solve the travelling salesman problem) just to show how clever we are.

New challenges and feedback from the Infinity Works Engineering Practice are welcomed in the form of pull requests and / or issues.
